## :dart: About ##

Day to day communication can be very challenging for people belonging to deaf communities.  They heavily rely on ASL or American Sign Language to communicate but this language is not understood by most people. Machine learning can be used to solve this problem as classifying objects through images by using machine learning models has already been demonstrated in a lot of studies. In this project, we have explored different convolutional neural networks with varying pre-processing methods to classify ASL images into correct letters. We have used custom CNN, ResNet50V2, and VGG16 models to make the predictions. For all these models we tried three different pre-processing techniques- mean normalization, standardization, and Zero Component Analysis. The model developed by transfer learning using ResNet with mean normalization was found to best among all the implementations with 83.74% accuracy.

## :sparkles: Features ##

:heavy_check_mark: We got 83 percent accuracy in classification of ASL images;\
:heavy_check_mark: compared 3 image preprocessing and best one is selected;
